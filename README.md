All elements that are relevant for the calculator functionality have such an attribute assigned to them in Webflow.

## Attributes

To connect functionality with elements, attributes are used. All elements that are relevant for the calculator functionality have such an attribute assigned to them in Webflow.

The attribute key is always "pp," as defined with this constant:

```ts
const ATTRIBUTE_KEY = "pp"
```

And with the helper function as (**a**ttribute **s**elector):

```ts
const as = (attributeValue: string): string => `[${ATTRIBUTE_KEY}='${attributeValue}']`
```

the attribute selector string can be generated.
